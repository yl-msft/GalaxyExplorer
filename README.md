# Galaxy Explorer

Galaxy Explorer is an open-source Windows Mixed Reality application that was originally developed in March 2016 as part of the [HoloLens 'Share Your Idea' campaign](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/12/01/announcing-the-microsoft-hololens-share-your-idea-campaign/) where the community submitted and voted on ideas. Since then Galaxy Explorer has been constantly updated with new features, also adding new platforms in the process.
